# IoT Communication System: Mobile App and Raspberry Pi Device  

This project was developed as part of my studies, combining software and hardware components to create a seamless IoT communication system. It showcases practical implementation of networking, cross-platform development, and system design.  

## Project Overview  

The project consists of two main components:  

1. **Mobile Application** (C# with .NET MAUI)  
2. **Device Code** (Python on Raspberry Pi 3)  

These modules enable efficient communication between a mobile app and a Raspberry Pi-based IoT device.

### Mobile Application (C# with .NET MAUI)  

The mobile app, developed using the **.NET MAUI** framework, leverages cross-platform capabilities and follows the **MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)** architecture. It incorporates basic principles of **services/microservices** for modularity and scalability.  

#### Key Features:  
- **Socket Communication**: Establishes and manages real-time connections with the Raspberry Pi device.  
- **Broadcast IP Discovery**: Automatically detects devices connected to the same network.  
- **Service-Based Architecture**: Modular design with services for better maintainability.  
- **MVVM Pattern**: Ensures separation of concerns and clean code organization.

### Device Code (Python on Raspberry Pi 3)  

The Python module handles the core communication logic on the Raspberry Pi. It ensures proper connection management and command execution.  

#### Key Features:  
- **Connection Management**: Listens for and accepts connection requests from the mobile app.  
- **Command Processing**: Executes commands received from the app in real time.  
- **Socket Communication**: Enables smooth two-way communication between the app and the device.
